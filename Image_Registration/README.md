Task: Two eye images are provided. Both are from the same person but taken from different angles and at different times. How much is the pupil dilated?

It cannot be compared directly since the images are of different sizes, shapes, and orientations.
Registrating the image gives a proper idea. It can be done using MATLAB's registration estimator tool (image provided).

The original image pupil diameter is around 103. After registration, it is around 115, which is more accurate.
